sample  of e-com project 
# React E-commerce Assignment

 This project is built using React with Vite.

 Use following Commands
   npm install
   npm run dev

  The project starts from the Homepage, which displays all product categories.

    If a category is selected, only products belonging to that specific category will be shown.

   Clicking on a product navigates to the Product Detail component, where users can:

   Add the item to the cart

   Or cancel/back out from the product view.

  Once a product is added to the cart:

  The cart icon updates to show the number of items added.

   Each item in the cart has a Remove button to delete it.

  At the bottom of the cart:

  The total price of all products is displayed.

  A "Dispatch" button is available for further action.

 

  *****Note***

   There may be some minor bugs in the product API, which can cause category-specific product rendering to behave unexpectedly at times.
